    <h2>What is LocalStack?</h2>
    <p>
        LocalStack is a fully functional local AWS cloud stack that enables you to develop and test your cloud and Serverless apps offline. It spins up an easy-to-use testing environment on your local machine that has the same APIs and works the same way as the real AWS cloud environment.
